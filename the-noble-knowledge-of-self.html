In that you may clothe your soul; it is the pearl which is not eaten by moths, and which no thief takes away. Seek it, and you will find a noble treasure." ~ Jacob Boehme 1575 - 1624 (Three Principles, ix. 1.)</p>
<p>Boehme suggests that we often chase after external sources of happiness - wealth, power, knowledge, or authority - but these things will ultimately leave us unfulfilled.</p>
<p>The "noble knowledge of self" is the key to unlocking a deeper sense of satisfaction and contentment. This knowledge isn't about ego or self-importance, but rather about gaining a profound understanding of who we truly are, beyond our external circumstances. When we cultivate this awareness, we can "clothe our soul" - meaning that we'll be able to nourish and care for our inner being.</p>
<p>The image Boehme uses is particularly evocative: the pearl that's not eaten by moths and can't be taken away by thieves represents a treasure that's uniquely our own. This treasure isn't subject to the whims of fate or external circumstances; it's a source of inner peace that we can draw upon regardless of what life brings.</p>
