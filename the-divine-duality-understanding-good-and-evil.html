</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>People blame dark forces for their misdeeds, miseries, and agonies, but whom should dark forces blame except Absolute God for their misdeeds and deviations? Absolute God is the ultimate guide and source for everyone and everything. And if everything is God and Absolute God is doing everything, good or bad, there is no logic of heaven or hell. But heaven and hell still exist and they are not for punishment, but for ranking and categorization of all beings. As water is needed, so is the need for fire; as good is needed, so is the need for evil. Good and evil are complementary.</p>
<p>Just imagine who created Satan, who gave Satan such huge powers and capabilities, and who allowed Satan to do such heinous acts: Absolute God. So, as light is divine, darkness is also divine. But be careful when you want to follow Satan or the dark forces; your spiritual rank will be destroyed, tainted, and dwarf, although you will still be following your beloved God. The choice is yours.</p>
