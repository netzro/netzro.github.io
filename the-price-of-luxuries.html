</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>People who want to live with innumerable luxuries in their lives are also destined to suffer innumerable mishaps, downfall, and catastrophes. If God gives us something above our survival needs, He also taxes some of our physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being in return. So, if you are more and more thriving in your material gains, you are also paying for it from your spiritual realms. This is where most of the people are deceived due to their own complacency. If a person is thriving materially and he or she is spending a big share from it on the uplift of other beings, this is the right attitude and such a person will not be taxed from the spiritual side and his or her all inner and outer realms will prosper. Our every act should be devotional and ecstatic so that we should have a strong basis for our spiritual excellence.</p>
<p>Excellence means much more than usual as true, brave, committed, and self-sacrificing people can only do excellent spiritual endeavors. We should make sure that we are doing very original and we come with a set of bigger efforts from our side to hit always remarkable and even greater targets in spiritual realms. Sincerity pays very well towards the end of the game. And courage gets us far far away.</p>
