Hi, I am Gift Owho, a self-taught hobbyist coder and web developer from Delta state in Nigeria 🇳🇬. I use the Python programming language in my daily workflow, hobbying around the great world of tech.

I also have interests in spirituality. The workings of our world have always fascinated me - how nature works by keeping everything in balance.

You can contact me by email

*Peace, Love, Balance.*  
☮️ 💚 ☯️
