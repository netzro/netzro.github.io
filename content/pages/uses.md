## My Daily Driver Setup
_last updated 11th August, 2024_

Not having a desktop computer or a laptop has not hampered my passion for tech in any way. Thankfully, I have a smartphone. As they say, what a computer can do, a smartphone can often do as well.

So, I pursued my passion with my smartphone.

In this post, I’ll document what I use as my daily driver.

### Hardware
My daily driver is a **Xiaomi Redmi 10C** that boasts:

- A 5000 mAh battery with 18W fast charging.
- 4 GB RAM with up to 2.4 GHz octa-core CPU.
- An Adreno 610 GPU.
- Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 4G (6 nm) chipset.
- 64 GB internal storage with a dedicated MicroSD slot (up to 8GB).

### Software
The device comes with **Android 11** running **MIUI 13**. 

As with all smartphones, what you install makes all the difference—so I made it count.
