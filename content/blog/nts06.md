> "To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's." - Fyodor Dostoevsky 

Every soul requires different experiences for the evolution of their consciousness. What might look like someone going down a very dark and destructive path, might just be the experience their soul needs to jolt them awake.  

No one person knows precisely what experiences another soul requires for their awakening. What is the right way for one soul, might just be the end for another.  

**Peace, Love, Balance.**
