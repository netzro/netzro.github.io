Four candles were burning calmly and were melting slowly... it was so quiet that I could hear their talk.

"I am PEACE.," said the first one, "unfortunately people do not know how to keep me. I have nothing left to do." And the flame of this candle went out. 

"I am FAITH unfortunately no one needs me," the second one said,
"even  people don't want to hear anything about me. So it makes no sense for me to burn further." A light breeze blew and extinguished the candle. 

After grieving, the third candle said: 
I am LOVE but people neither appreciate nor understand me. I have no more energy to burn. 
And that candle too faded away.

Suddenly, a child came into the room and, saw three extinguished candles. Scared, he shouted, "Why are you not burning? You should give light. I am afraid of the darkness." Saying all that he began to cry.

Then the fourth candle said, "Don't be afraid and don't cry. While I burn, you can always light up other three. I am HOPE."

**Peace, Love, Balance.**
