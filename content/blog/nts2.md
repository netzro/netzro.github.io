Detachment is the ability to
maintain emotional and 
psychological distance 
from situations, outcomes,
and people…without becoming
overly involved or affected by them. 
Detachment doesn't mean 
indifference or lack of empathy… 
it’s about not being overly 
influenced by others emotions 
or expectations. 🙏🤍
