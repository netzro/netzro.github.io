> "Make your own Bible. Select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

As we dive into this wisdom, let's first consider what Emerson is suggesting. He's not advocating for creating a new holy book or replacing existing sacred texts, but rather encouraging each individual to curate their own spiritual guidebook. This "personal Bible" would be a collection of quotes, phrases, and ideas that have had a profound impact on one's life and understanding of the world.  

Emerson is proposing that we should actively seek out the words and sentences that resonate deeply with us, like the blast of a trumpet – loud, clear, and unforgettable. These passages might come from various sources: sacred texts, philosophical treatises, poetry, or even personal experiences. The key is to identify what speaks directly to our souls, what sparks our imagination, and what inspires us to be more compassionate, wise, and just.  

What are the words and phrases that have been like a blast of a trumpet in your life? Which passages or quotes have had a profound impact on your values, beliefs, or understanding of yourself and the world?  


**Peace, Love, Balance.**
