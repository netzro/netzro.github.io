This week marks the beginning of my Weeknote series. I'm excited to share that I successfully published this blog on GitHub Pages! Overall, it was a fun week. While there isn't much to say in this inaugural note, I did enjoy reading some articles and watching a few new movies.

In addition to these activities, I also managed to do some accounting for both my personal and business finances. I plan to dive deeper into these topics in future posts.

#### Articles I Read
