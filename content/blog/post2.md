summary: Key to fulfillment is profound understanding of self.
---

"Neither money nor worldly possessions, neither science nor authority, will bring to you the sweet rest of paradise, at which you can arrive only by the noble knowledge of self. In that you may clothe your soul; it is the pearl which is not eaten by moths, and which no thief takes away. Seek it, and you will find a noble treasure." ~ Jacob Boehme 1575 - 1624 (Three Principles, ix. 1.)

Boehme suggests that we often chase after external sources of happiness - wealth, power, knowledge, or authority - but these things will ultimately leave us unfulfilled.

The "noble knowledge of self" is the key to unlocking a deeper sense of satisfaction and contentment. This knowledge isn't about ego or self-importance, but rather about gaining a profound understanding of who we truly are, beyond our external circumstances. When we cultivate this awareness, we can "clothe our soul" - meaning that we'll be able to nourish and care for our inner being.

The image Boehme uses is particularly evocative: the pearl that's not eaten by moths and can't be taken away by thieves represents a treasure that's uniquely our own. This treasure isn't subject to the whims of fate or external circumstances; it's a source of inner peace that we can draw upon regardless of what life brings.
