Following my commitment to watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films in order of their release dates as mentioned in my [previous post]({filename}/posts/2024/Sep/19/watching-marvel-movies-in-order.md), I have successfully completed Phase 1. This phase includes *Iron Man* (May 2008), *The Incredible Hulk* (June 2008), *Iron Man 2*
(April 2010), *Thor* (April 2011), *Captain America: The First Avenger* (July 2011), and *The Avengers* (April 2012).

I must say that *The Avengers* was definitely worth watching again. Viewing all these films once more has deepened my understanding of the storyline, events, and character development.

I am excited to continue and complete Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
