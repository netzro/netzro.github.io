I recently explored dotfiles and learned how to set them up with version control using Git. I applied this to my bash files (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_aliases`) and configured my dotfiles so that I can easily use them on any system. This is achieved by pulling from my Git repository and symlinking the dotfiles to their original locations on the system.

I also discovered that this approach can be extended to configuration files—the dotfiles for packages installed on Linux. This means that whenever I install a package, I can add its dotfile to my dotfile directory.

This dotfiles management project is ongoing.
