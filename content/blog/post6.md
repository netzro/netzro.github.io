The difference between being generous and being kind. 

I used to commonsensically see both as the same, until I stumbled on some explanations....

So, Being Generous is Not the Same as Being Kind

There the elderly lady sat outside in such a way that passersby could tell she had been there for long and assume she was begging for money.  Approaching, I noticed a man talking to her and as I came closer heard her explain that her ride (apparently a relative of some sort) had not come to pick her up.  In fact, the situation was opposite what passersby surmised – she offered to pay him to give her a ride home.  The man agreed (but turned down the money) and two or three of us helped her get into his car.  After the door closed, one of the helpers said, “I hope she doesn’t trick you into falling in the hands of kidnappers or bad people using her as a set up” to which the voluntary chauffeur replied, “She doesn’t look like someone who’s packing heat.”  I didn’t read anything the next day about such in the neighborhood, so I assumed she got home okay.

The point is this.  The generous person would have given, or at least offered, money and moved on.  The kind person, on the other hand, offered something more important – time, effort and understanding.  Even at possible risk.

Time, Kindness, Essence.

Kindness is the essence of exaltation and time is the essence of kindness.

Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin put it this way:

> “Kindness is the essence of a celestial life.  Kindness is how a Christ-like person treats others.  Kindness should permeate all of our words and actions.
