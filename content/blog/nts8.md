The stark reality of humanity is that we came here with nothing materially and we would return materially with nothing!.
Hence, the Vanities of our misplaced priorities like greediness, hatred, war, envy, backstabbing or backbiting, etc!.
I believe our priorities should be humanity,beauty, creativity, unity and thus Unveiling in Us the "divinity in humanity"!.
This would liberates us from our current vanities and establish for us a noble legacy!.
Interestingly, this is not only Possible but Achievable for "We Are The World"!.
Best wishes for a glorious and fulfilled existence to all and peace profound to the world!.
