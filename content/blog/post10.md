A certain person recently delivered a speech at a university alumni association on the topic of "Dilemma after middle-age". 

The audience, consisting of about 700 people, couldn't help but burst into laughter throughout the speech. 

Here is the full text:
 
Dear classmates,
 
There is a song that sings ...
"Tomorrow will be better" to give people confidence and encouragement. 

In real life, however, we can't be certain if tomorrow will truly be better. 
What we can be sure of is that tomorrow, we will be older.
 
As the years pass, we come to understand the harshness of time. 

At a certain age, we have to admit the power of gravity. 
Our organs are still there, but they seem to be drooping. 

As the saying goes, 
"Everything is drooping, only blood pressure is high."
 
Our bodies undergo significant changes after reaching middle age. 

The once guitar-shaped figure now resembles a pear. 

We fall asleep when sitting and struggle to sleep when lying down. 

We can't remember what we want to remember and can't forget what we want to forget. 

To make matters worse, we shed no tears when we cry and have to wipe away tears when we laugh. 

And let's not forget the "white hair that can never be combed out, growing again with the spring breeze" on our heads. 

Men's hairstyles, as described by the novelist Mo Yan, are like "the local supporting the central," with hair combed from both sides to the middle in an attempt to cover the sparse hair in the middle.
 
Our memory also gradually declines. 
We find ourselves walking from one room to another, only to forget why we came in the first place. 

We repeat ourselves, forgetting what we just said. 
There was even an old man who once laughed halfway and forgot why he was laughing.
 
While young couples grow old together, what should middle-aged couples do? 

It's not easy to change our bad habits. Life is like "saving the whole and paying the little," gradually passing away. 

The young individuals who were once full of vigor and vitality have now become fragile old men in the blink of an eye. 

Some people even mock the elderly, claiming that they are experiencing "knowledge degeneration, organ ageing, and rigid thinking, waiting for cremation."
 
But it is up to us to cultivate our minds. As someone said:
"Age does not matter as long as the matter does not age."

We may grow old, but our hearts should remain youthful. 

Wrinkles may appear on our faces, but they should not reflect the state of our hearts. 

Consider this: 
some people don't have the privilege to grow old; they pass away at a young age.
 
We should also adjust our attitude towards life. 

In the past, we traded our health for wealth, but now we must trade our wealth for health. 

Life is said to consist of three stages: 

(1) Young people strive for a good education, 

(2) Success in middle age relies on experience, and 

(3) As we grow older, we must pay attention to our medical history.
 
In any case, I wish all my dear friends good health, happiness, a heart as mischievous as a child, and a smile on their faces. 

Let's ask for another 40 years from God, shall we?
 
Lastly, let's remember the four most fashionable truths of 2024:

① Don't show off your money; 
it doesn't belong to you until you use it.

② Don't show off your work; 
if you stumble, countless others will do better than you.

③ Don't show off your house; 
once you're gone, it becomes someone else's nest.

④ Don't show off your car; 
when you're no longer around, the car keys will be in someone else's hands.
 
The only thing worth showing off is... Your Health....! 

When others are gone, you can still bask in the sun, sip tea, and enjoy a healthy life. 

Please take good care of yourselves because replacement parts are hard to come by and extremely expensive! 
They're not in stock yet...
 
This speech is filled with truth and humor. 
It brings tears to our eyes and laughter to our hearts. 😊🤭😆😂

It's truly a rare and wonderful piece.🎯🎯
