## The Cube

Recently, I decided to buy myself a Rubik's Cube and see how easy or hard solving it would be. In this series of mini-posts, I’ll share my experience and the steps I followed to solve the cube.

## The Challenge

When I first held the cube and scrambled it, I realized that solving it was going to be more than just a quick puzzle. It requires a methodical approach and an algorithm. After some research and watching YouTube videos, I found the Beginner's Method to be the best way to start. But first, I needed to understand the notations used when solving the cube.  

## Understanding Rubik's Cube Notation

When solving a Rubik's Cube, algorithms are often represented using a specific notation. Here’s a quick guide that helped me understand the symbols:

- **U (Up):** Rotate the top face of the cube clockwise.
- **U' (Up Prime):** Rotate the top face of the cube counterclockwise.
- **U2 (Up Double):** Rotate the top face of the cube 180 degrees (two quarter turns).

The same notation applies to other faces:

- **R (Right):** Rotate the right face of the cube clockwise.
- **R' (Right Prime):** Rotate the right face counterclockwise.
- **R2 (Right Double):** Rotate the right face 180 degrees.

- **L (Left):** Rotate the left face of the cube clockwise.
- **L' (Left Prime):** Rotate the left face counterclockwise.
- **L2 (Left Double):** Rotate the left face 180 degrees.

- **F (Front):** Rotate the front face of the cube clockwise.
- **F' (Front Prime):** Rotate the front face counterclockwise.
- **F2 (Front Double):** Rotate the front face 180 degrees.

- **B (Back):** Rotate the back face of the cube clockwise.
- **B' (Back Prime):** Rotate the back face counterclockwise.
- **B2 (Back Double):** Rotate the back face 180 degrees.

- **D (Down):** Rotate the bottom face of the cube clockwise.
- **D' (Down Prime):** Rotate the bottom face counterclockwise.
- **D2 (Down Double):** Rotate the bottom face 180 degrees.

### Example Algorithm

An example of an algorithm might look like this:

```markdown
R U R' U'
```

In the next post, I will start solving the cube.
