I will be posting a series titled **Weeknotes** that will cover most of the things I do during the week, with sub-headings such as:

- Articles I read from blogs and websites
- Books I am reading, if any
- Music that inspired me during the week
- Movies I watched, as a fan of films
- Any other things that caught my interest

The naming structure will be:

`Weeknote:#number:week:year`

This naming structure may evolve if necessary, but for now, I will stick with this for simplicity.

Another random series titled **Note to Self (NTS)** will also feature on this blog. Its content will vary but will be short and precise, touching on various aspects of life. It will definitely have meaning and impact on my life.

The naming structure for this series will be:

`NTS:year-#number`

Other posts will definitely come in between at various times, but for now, I will focus on these.

**Peace, Love, Balance.**
