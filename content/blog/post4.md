summary: Revelations depend on our consciousness and can vary greatly.

There are so many forms of revelations we may encounter if we are in affair with Absolute Divinity. Our revelations quality and frequency depend on our level of consciousness. A revelation may be in the form of our dream which may come true after a while. But understanding the true meanings of a dream is also a challenge, because most dreams are not straightforward. They cannot be understood easily by a naive person. A revelation may be any idea or information clearly and persistently settling in our hearts for no apparent reason. A revelation may be the words of another person, anything written on the wall, or something being mentioned in a video which catches not only our attention, but it also glares our hearts and we feel that this is the solution to our pressing problems.

Not all revelations are reliable or equally important. Some revelations are very strong and vivid. Other revelations are half truth, because our heart is not completely satisfied with the idea or information. Still some revelations prove to be very weak or wrong. So, we have to be careful and should try to check other sources of revelation or information before making any move based on our intuitions and revelations. Based on our past karma and our present intentions, our revelations may be very strong or weak. All this system of revelation improves if we value these revelations and try to use them for a greater good of the society and according to divine limits. We should not use these revelations for our arrogance, unnecessary fame, revenge and luxuries.
