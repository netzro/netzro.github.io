Crowley's concept of the 'Master' and the 'Slave' was appropriated from Nietzsche. Crowley thought enough of Nietzsche's philosophy to canonize him as a saint of the Gnostic Catholic Church.

"The Book [of the Law] announces a new dichotomy in human society; there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the "lone wolf" and the herd." -- Aleister Crowley, MWT

Crowley's footnote to this comment goes on to say:

"The "Master" roughly denotes the able, the adventurous, welcoming responsibility.  The "slave:" his motto is "Safety first," with all that this implies."

In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche (1844-1900 CE) detects two types of morality mixed not only in higher civilization but also in the psychology of the individual. Master-morality values power, nobility, and independence: it stands “beyond good and evil.” Slave-morality values sympathy, kindness, and humility and is regarded by Nietzsche as “herd-morality.” The history of society, Nietzsche believes, is the conflict between these two outlooks: the herd attempts to impose its values universally, but the noble master transcends their “mediocrity.” [1]

The essence of slave morality is utility, and all that this implies. John Stuart Mills Utilitarianism is an example of slave morality codified by academic philosophy.  [2]

Anyone that has never deeply questioned the values of their culture and society is by definition a 'slave' according to the Nietzsche / Crowley scheme.
