1. When strange or bad things happen, they ask God questions, they don't thank him.

2. When they want food, they go to farms they don't go to pray in their shrines.

3. When any of them commits sin, he is punished to deter others from doing the same, they don't tell God to forgive him.

4. When they want money, they sell their farm products, they don't pray to God to give them.

5. When they are sick, they go to an herbalist or make use of herbs and roots, they don't wait for miracles.

6. When they want a wife, they investigate the would-be in-laws, they don't pray in the shrine for signs and wonders.

7. When one of them dies, they come together and bury him, they don't calculate and request the payment of his shrine levies before burial.

8. The village Chief priest has his farm and works to sustain his family, he doesn't wait for tithes and offerings.

9. Their wives respect and call their husbands my lord and not the chief priest.

10. Our ancestors never built a billion naira house for their God and live in trenches, rather they built poor huts because a God doesn't need a house.
