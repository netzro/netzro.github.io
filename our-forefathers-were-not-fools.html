<p>When strange or bad things happen, they ask God questions, they don't thank him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they want food, they go to farms they don't go to pray in their shrines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When any of them commits sin, he is punished to deter others from doing the same, they don't tell God to forgive him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they want money, they sell their farm products, they don't pray to God to give them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they are sick, they go to an herbalist or make use of herbs and roots, they don't wait for miracles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they want a wife, they investigate the would-be in-laws, they don't pray in the shrine for signs and wonders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one of them dies, they come together and bury him, they don't calculate and request the payment of his shrine levies before burial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The village Chief priest has his farm and works to sustain his family, he doesn't wait for tithes and offerings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their wives respect and call their husbands my lord and not the chief priest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our ancestors never built a billion naira house for their God and live in trenches, rather they built poor huts because a God doesn't need a house.</p>
