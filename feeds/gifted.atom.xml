Having been online for decades, I've ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Managing passwords without a dedicated password manager can be a challenge. Having been online for decades, I've encountered countless sites and services requiring passwords‚Äîranging from email services and banking sites to forums and chat platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering all these usernames and passwords is difficult, so I used to rely on using the same or similar passwords across different platforms‚Äîa practice I &lt;strong&gt;strongly&lt;/strong&gt; advise against. However, I often defaulted to using built-in password managers in browsers and Google services (on my Android smartphone). Typically, once I created login credentials, I would let the browser save them to its database and autofill them whenever I revisited the site, eliminating the need to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I decided to explore how a password manager works. I've heard of 1Password, Bitwarden, etc., but I wanted something simple, lightweight, and minimalistic. After some research, I settled on "Pass," which is often touted as the default password manager for Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will document my workflow for setting up Pass on my Linux environment (Termux) and Android smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Generating a GPG Key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I generated a GPG key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;gnupg
gpg&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--gen-key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting Up Pass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pass
pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--version
pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;gpg-id&amp;gt;
pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add some passwords to Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;insert&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;test.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a private repository on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull and push your Pass store to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pull&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remote&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;repo-url&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
pass&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remote&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;repo-url&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;branch&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a future post, we‚Äôll explore how to install Android Password Store and set it up as my primary password manager instead of relying on Google.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="#100DaysToOffload"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Weeknote-001:24</title><link href="/posts/2024/Aug/11/weeknote-00124/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-11T20:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-08-11T20:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gifted</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-08-11:/posts/2024/Aug/11/weeknote-00124/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week marks the beginning of my Weeknote series.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these activities, I also managed to do some accounting for both my personal and business finances. I plan to dive deeper into these topics in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what I intend to do:
- Keep a tracker on my blog for my progress.
- Tag all related posts with #100DaysToOffload.
- Stay dedicated and hope to accomplish this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Python enthusiast, I used Pelican, a static site generator, to create and deploy this site/blog to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process was both fun and informative, and I'll be documenting it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, you'll need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GitHub account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Linux environment (I used Termux on my phone since I don't have a laptop).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's begin by creating a repository on GitHub named:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initialize it with a &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file that includes the following entries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;venv/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;output/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, create two branches: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; amd &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the repository settings, go to Pages and set &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; as the branch to serve your static files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Linux environment, clone the repository you just created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone &amp;lt;URL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate into the newly cloned repository and create a virtual environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activate it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;source venv/bin/activate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it's time to install Pelican. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install pelican markdown tzdata ghp-import
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save your dependencies, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip freeze &amp;gt; requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all for today. In the next post, we'll generate our site and publish it to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="#100DaysToOffload"></category></entry><entry><title>How to turn vices into virtues</title><link href="/posts/2024/Jul/19/how-to-turn-vices-into-virtues/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gifted</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-07-19:/posts/2024/Jul/19/how-to-turn-vices-into-virtues/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle is one of history's most influential thinkers.

Born in 384 BCE, he studied under Plato and later tutored Alexander the Great. One of his contributions to philosophy is the concept of the Golden Mean.
The Golden Mean is the moderation of vices, making them virtues. A balance between extremes.
Aristotle said that virtue lies between deficiency and excess. For instance, courage is a virtue between the vices of recklessness and cowardice. The reckless person acts regardless of risk. While the coward avoids risk altogether. The courageous person balances the two. Facing danger with the right amount of fear and confidence.
The virtue of generosity is the mean of the two vices of wastefulness and stinginess. Modesty is between shamelessness and bashfulness. Confidence balances arrogance and insecurity.
Many people go through opposite extremes during their lives to gain perspective and understanding of the perfect median.
Aristotle's Golden Mean emerged from his broader investigation into human happiness. He believed that eudaimonia, or happiness, required living with virtue.
Virtue, in turn, was about finding the appropriate mean in various aspects of life. This balance was not a strict middle point but was context-dependent, varying from person to person and situation to situation.
This variation is due to differences in individual characteristics. These can include things like temperament, physical condition, social circumstances, and life experiences.
For example, the right amount of food for an athlete in training would be different for a sedentary person. Level of generosity will be relative to a person's resources. The amount of courage needed by a soldier will be different from that of a civilian.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Master and Slave</title><link href="/posts/2024/Jul/13/master-and-slave/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gifted</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-07-13:/posts/2024/Jul/13/master-and-slave/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crowley's concept of the 'Master' and the 'Slave' was appropriated from Nietzsche.

&lt;p&gt;"The Book [of the Law] announces a new dichotomy in human society; there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the "lone wolf" and the herd." -- Aleister Crowley, MWT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowley's footnote to this comment goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The "Master" roughly denotes the able, the adventurous, welcoming responsibility.  The "slave:" his motto is "Safety first," with all that this implies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche (1844-1900 CE) detects two types of morality mixed not only in higher civilization but also in the psychology of the individual. Master-morality values power, nobility, and independence: it stands ‚Äúbeyond good and evil.‚Äù Slave-morality values sympathy, kindness, and humility and is regarded by Nietzsche as ‚Äúherd-morality.‚Äù The history of society, Nietzsche believes, is the conflict between these two outlooks: the herd attempts to impose its values universally, but the noble master transcends their ‚Äúmediocrity.‚Äù [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of slave morality is utility, and all that this implies. John Stuart Mills Utilitarianism is an example of slave morality codified by academic philosophy.  [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has never deeply questioned the values of their culture and society is by definition a 'slave' according to the Nietzsche / Crowley scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience, consisting of about 700 people, couldn't help but burst into laughter throughout the speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear classmates,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a song that sings ...
"Tomorrow will be better" to give people confidence and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, however, we can't be certain if tomorrow will truly be better. 
What we can be sure of is that tomorrow, we will be older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, we come to understand the harshness of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain age, we have to admit the power of gravity. 
Our organs are still there, but they seem to be drooping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, 
"Everything is drooping, only blood pressure is high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies undergo significant changes after reaching middle age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once guitar-shaped figure now resembles a pear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fall asleep when sitting and struggle to sleep when lying down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't remember what we want to remember and can't forget what we want to forget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, we shed no tears when we cry and have to wipe away tears when we laugh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's not forget the "white hair that can never be combed out, growing again with the spring breeze" on our heads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men's hairstyles, as described by the novelist Mo Yan, are like "the local supporting the central," with hair combed from both sides to the middle in an attempt to cover the sparse hair in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our memory also gradually declines. 
We find ourselves walking from one room to another, only to forget why we came in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We repeat ourselves, forgetting what we just said. 
There was even an old man who once laughed halfway and forgot why he was laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While young couples grow old together, what should middle-aged couples do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to change our bad habits. Life is like "saving the whole and paying the little," gradually passing away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young individuals who were once full of vigor and vitality have now become fragile old men in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people even mock the elderly, claiming that they are experiencing "knowledge degeneration, organ ageing, and rigid thinking, waiting for cremation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is up to us to cultivate our minds. As someone said:
"Age does not matter as long as the matter does not age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may grow old, but our hearts should remain youthful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrinkles may appear on our faces, but they should not reflect the state of our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: 
some people don't have the privilege to grow old; they pass away at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should also adjust our attitude towards life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we traded our health for wealth, but now we must trade our wealth for health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is said to consist of three stages: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Young people strive for a good education, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Success in middle age relies on experience, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) As we grow older, we must pay attention to our medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I wish all my dear friends good health, happiness, a heart as mischievous as a child, and a smile on their faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's ask for another 40 years from God, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let's remember the four most fashionable truths of 2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ë† Don't show off your money; 
it doesn't belong to you until you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ë° Don't show off your work; 
if you stumble, countless others will do better than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ë¢ Don't show off your house; 
once you're gone, it becomes someone else's nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ë£ Don't show off your car; 
when you're no longer around, the car keys will be in someone else's hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing worth showing off is... Your Health....! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When others are gone, you can still bask in the sun, sip tea, and enjoy a healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take good care of yourselves because replacement parts are hard to come by and extremely expensive! 
They're not in stock yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This speech is filled with truth and humor. 
It brings tears to our eyes and laughter to our hearts. üòäü§≠üòÜüòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly a rare and wonderful piece.üéØüéØ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced grounding&lt;/strong&gt;: Dew represents the divine nectar, and walking on dewy grass amplifies the grounding effect, connecting the individual with the earth's energies and the divine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purification and cleansing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dew is seen as a symbol of purification, and walking on dewy grass is believed to cleanse the energy fields, removing negative energies and promoting spiritual renewal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection to the divine feminine&lt;/strong&gt;: Dew is associated with the divine feminine, and walking on dewy grass represents a connection to the nurturing, receptive, and creative aspects of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolic baptism&lt;/strong&gt;: Walking on dewy grass can be seen as a symbolic baptism, representing a spiritual rebirth and renewal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced spiritual growth&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of earth, grass, and dew is believed to facilitate spiritual growth, allowing the individual to access higher states of consciousness and connect with the divine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacred ritual&lt;/strong&gt;: Walking barefoot on dewy grass is often performed as a sacred ritual, signifying a commitment to spiritual growth, self-awareness, and connection with nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energetic alignment&lt;/strong&gt;: Dewy grass is believed to hold a specific energetic frequency, which aligns the individual's energy with the natural world, promoting balance and harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By walking barefoot on dewy grass, mystics seek to tap into the sacred energies of nature, connect with the divine, and cultivate spiritual growth, purification, and renewal. Learn to do this at least once a week.

Absolute God is the ultimate guide and source for everyone and everything. And if everything is God and Absolute God is doing everything, good or bad, there is no logic of heaven or hell. But heaven and hell still exist and they are not for punishment, but for ranking and categorization of all beings. As water is needed, so is the need for fire; as good is needed, so is the need for evil. Good and evil are complementary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine who created Satan, who gave Satan such huge powers and capabilities, and who allowed Satan to do such heinous acts: Absolute God. So, as light is divine, darkness is also divine. But be careful when you want to follow Satan or the dark forces; your spiritual rank will be destroyed, tainted, and dwarf, although you will still be following your beloved God.

&lt;p&gt;The difference between being generous and being kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to commonsensically see both as the same, until I stumbled on some explanations....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Being Generous is Not the Same as Being Kind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There the elderly lady sat outside in such a way that passersby could tell she had been there for long and assume she was begging for money.  Approaching, I noticed a man talking to her and as I came closer heard her explain that her ride (apparently a relative of some sort) had not come to pick her up.  In fact, the situation was opposite what passersby surmised ‚Äì she offered to pay him to give her a ride home.  The man agreed (but turned down the money) and two or three of us helped her get into his car.  After the door closed, one of the helpers said, ‚ÄúI hope she doesn‚Äôt trick you into falling in the hands of kidnappers or bad people using her as a set up‚Äù to which the voluntary chauffeur replied, ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt look like someone who‚Äôs packing heat.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt read anything the next day about such in the neighborhood, so I assumed she got home okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this.  The generous person would have given, or at least offered, money and moved on.  The kind person, on the other hand, offered something more important ‚Äì time, effort and understanding.  Even at possible risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, Kindness, Essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindness is the essence of exaltation and time is the essence of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúKindness is the essence of a celestial life.  Kindness is how a Christ-like person treats others.  Kindness should permeate all of our words and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Our revelations quality and frequency depend on our level of consciousness. A revelation may be in the form of our dream which may come true after a while. But understanding the true meanings of a dream is also a challenge, because most dreams are not straightforward. They cannot be understood easily by a naive person. A revelation may be any idea or information clearly and persistently settling in our hearts for no apparent reason. A revelation may be the words of another person, anything written on the wall, or something being mentioned in a video which catches not only our attention, but it also glares our hearts and we feel that this is the solution to our pressing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all revelations are reliable or equally important. Some revelations are very strong and vivid. Other revelations are half truth, because our heart is not completely satisfied with the idea or information. Still some revelations prove to be very weak or wrong. So, we have to be careful and should try to check other sources of revelation or information before making any move based on our intuitions and revelations. Based on our past karma and our present intentions, our revelations may be very strong or weak. All this system of revelation improves if we value these revelations and try to use them for a greater good of the society and according to divine limits. We should not use these revelations for our arrogance, unnecessary fame, revenge and luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>The Price of Luxuries</title><link href="/posts/2024/Jun/15/the-price-of-luxuries/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gifted</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-06-15:/posts/2024/Jun/15/the-price-of-luxuries/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the spiritual costs of material abundance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People who want to live with innumerable luxuries in their lives are also destined to suffer innumerable mishaps, downfall, and catastrophes. If God gives us something above our survival needs, He also taxes some of our physical, emotional, or spiritual well-being in return. So, if you are more and more thriving in your material gains, you are also paying for it from your spiritual realms. This is where most of the people are deceived due to their own complacency. If a person is thriving materially and he or she is spending a big share from it on the uplift of other beings, this is the right attitude and such a person will not be taxed from the spiritual side and his or her all inner and outer realms will prosper. Our every act should be devotional and ecstatic so that we should have a strong basis for our spiritual excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence means much more than usual as true, brave, committed, and self-sacrificing people can only do excellent spiritual endeavors. We should make sure that we are doing very original and we come with a set of bigger efforts from our side to hit always remarkable and even greater targets in spiritual realms. Sincerity pays very well towards the end of the game. And courage gets us far far away.&lt;/p&gt;

In that you may clothe your soul; it is the pearl which is not eaten by moths, and which no thief takes away. Seek it, and you will find a noble treasure." ~ Jacob Boehme 1575 - 1624 (Three Principles, ix. 1.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehme suggests that we often chase after external sources of happiness - wealth, power, knowledge, or authority - but these things will ultimately leave us unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "noble knowledge of self" is the key to unlocking a deeper sense of satisfaction and contentment. This knowledge isn't about ego or self-importance, but rather about gaining a profound understanding of who we truly are, beyond our external circumstances. When we cultivate this awareness, we can "clothe our soul" - meaning that we'll be able to nourish and care for our inner being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image Boehme uses is particularly evocative: the pearl that's not eaten by moths and can't be taken away by thieves represents a treasure that's uniquely our own. This treasure isn't subject to the whims of fate or external circumstances; it's a source of inner peace that we can draw upon regardless of what life brings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>"Our Forefathers Were Not Fools"</title><link href="/posts/2024/Jun/13/our-forefathers-were-not-fools/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Gifted</name></author><id>tag:None,2024-06-13:/posts/2024/Jun/13/our-forefathers-were-not-fools/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Ten principles showing the practical wisdom of our ancestors."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When strange or bad things happen, they ask God questions, they don't thank him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they want food, they go to farms they don't go to pray in their shrines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When any of them commits sin, he is punished to deter others from doing the same, they don't tell God to forgive him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they want money, they sell their farm products, they don't pray to God to give them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they are sick, they go to an herbalist or make use of herbs and roots, they don't wait for miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they want a wife, they investigate the would-be in-laws, they don't pray in the shrine for signs and wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one of them dies, they come together and bury him, they don't calculate and request the payment of his shrine levies before burial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The village Chief priest has his farm and works to sustain his family, he doesn't wait for tithes and offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their wives respect and call their husbands my lord and not the chief priest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ancestors never built a billion naira house for their God and live in trenches, rather they built poor huts because a God doesn't need a house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hetty Green, often referred to as the most stingy woman in history, amassed a wealth estimated at more than $2.3 billion. Born in America in 1835, she was the only daughter of a wealthy businessman and inherited a fortune of $7.5 million from her father. At twenty-one, she moved to New York to invest in Wall Street, earning the nickname the Wicked Witch of Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite marrying a millionaire, Hetty lived frugally, subsisting on leftover cakes and broken biscuits from grocery stores and arguing daily for a free bone for her dog. Known for her extreme miserliness, she sewed her own underpants at sixteen and wore them until her death, never spending on hot water, wearing the same black dress until it wore out, and eating a two-cent pie. Her son had to have his leg amputated after she delayed treatment to avoid spending money, searching for free medical care instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetty Green died in 1916 at 81 in New York City, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‚Äúmost stingy person in the world.‚Äù She died from a stroke during a quarrel with her maid over a salary increase. Her children, in contrast, were generous; her daughter even built a free hospital with the inherited fortune.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
